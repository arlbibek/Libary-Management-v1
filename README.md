## Library Management System

> This started as an academic course work but I've made improvements in the code as my knowledge and familiarity with python has improved over the years.

This is a simple python command line application that reads books information from a text file maintained by a Library.
The program helps in keeping track of borrowed books and also the books returned by the readers. Also generates a note (i.e Invoice) for both borrowed and returned book while simultaneously updating the information to the text file.
