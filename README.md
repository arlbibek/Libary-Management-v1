## Libary-Management
>This is an academic course work.

This is a simple python command line application that reads books information from a text file maintained by a Library.
The program helps in keeping track of borrowed books and also the books returned by the readers. Also generets a note (i.e Invoice) for both borrowed and returned book while simultaneously updating the information to the text file.

An improved version of this code can be found [here](https://github.com/arlbibek/Libary-Management-v2 "Go to Libary-Management-v2").
